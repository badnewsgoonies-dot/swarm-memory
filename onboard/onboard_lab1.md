Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. When planning tests for specific functionalities, ensure to gather comprehensive details about the implementation to identify relevant edge cases effectively.
2. For effective edge-case testing, always define the core functionalities early, and use existing documentation or team insights to identify potential edge cases before planning tests.
3. Always review existing project documentation and edge cases when devising a test plan to ensure coverage of critical functionalities.
4. Identifying edge cases requires a thorough understanding of core functionalities and active collaboration with the team to fill knowledge gaps.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
