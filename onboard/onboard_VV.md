# Onboarding: VV

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. For VV tasks, always combine similarity + time decay. Pure similarity ranks stale entries too high.
2. When porting React to Preact, always check hook import paths first - most errors come from wrong imports.
3. Always ensure edge cases are thoroughly tested in scoring algorithms to confirm accuracy across varying scenarios.
4. Always consider both the temporal and semantic implications of scoring in tests for new data conditions to avoid misranking issues.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
