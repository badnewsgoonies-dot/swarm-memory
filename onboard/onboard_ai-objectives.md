# Onboarding: ai-objectives

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. Objective anti-patterns: overbroad (no scope/tests/cap), overnarrow (misses root cause), misaligned reward (minimize lines→bad code), hidden coupling (ignores deps), no stop condition (infinite loops). Always define DoD and escalation rules.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
