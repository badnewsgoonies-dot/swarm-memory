# Onboarding: learning-loops

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. Avoid bad lessons baking in: require evidence_ref and source_refs (reject without links), low default confidence, promote to rule only after >=2 corroborated results. Auto-deprecate on counter-evidence, TTL-based revalidation.
2. Memory hygiene cadence: weekly consolidate/prune for active topics, monthly global sweep. Consolidate similar lessons, prune contradicted rules, archive lessons with no retrieval hits after TTL*2.
3. Prompt patterns for lessons: Planning preamble lists relevant rules as hard constraints + lessons with applicability/risk. Action check template validates against rules before execution. Post-task reflection proposes new lessons.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
