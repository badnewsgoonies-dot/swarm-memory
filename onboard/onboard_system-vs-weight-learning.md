# Onboarding: system-vs-weight-learning

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. System-level learning limits: bounded by base model reasoning, brittle if retrieval fails, long-context costs, lacks generalization to unseen modalities. Practical ceiling: excellent assistant, falls short on new cognitive skills.
2. System-level quality control: RULE brevity <200 chars imperative, attach links to exemplars, expire stale lessons via prune, rules-first prompt ordering, periodic consolidate+embed+sync cron.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
