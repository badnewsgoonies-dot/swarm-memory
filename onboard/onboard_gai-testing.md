# Onboarding: gai-testing

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. Proto-GAI sandbox ideas: programmatic ARC-like generator (new rules each run), cross-domain treasure hunt (changing clue formats), continual mini-curriculum (3 sessions/day over week), self-debug loop (seeded bugs in code+prose).

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
