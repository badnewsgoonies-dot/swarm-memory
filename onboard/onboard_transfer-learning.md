# Onboarding: transfer-learning

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. Transfer success criteria: ≥80% function accuracy on novel objects with zero domain cues, explanations hit ≥1.5/2 rubric, <15% drop from train to test, calibrated uncertainty. Maximize transfer by keeping procedure stepwise and mechanism-oriented, avoid object-specific lexicon.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
