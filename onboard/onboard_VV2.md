Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. When porting state management solutions, always ensure to review existing logic and state flows to create an accurate corresponding structure in the new system.
2. Thoroughly assess existing components and their logic when migrating them to ensure an accurate and efficient rebuild process.
3. Transitioning from React to Preact requires careful assessment of lifecycle methods and component features unique to React; thorough testing post-porting is essential to validate functionality.
4. When porting components between libraries like React and Preact, focus on understanding lifecycle differences and ensuring type safety throughout the transition.
5. When porting features, always ensure to carefully analyze existing state management patterns and component interactions to maintain compatibility.
6. When porting state management solutions, systematically analyze the existing state structure and component interactions to ensure a comprehensive and functional transition.
7. Always verify the specific differences in APIs and lifecycle methods when migrating components between frameworks to avoid runtime issues.
8. When porting components between libraries like React and Preact, it is crucial to thoroughly analyze differences in lifecycle methods and ensure type safety throughout the transition.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
