# Onboarding: code-physics

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. Code physics anti-patterns: ignoring exit codes, blind trust in network/filesystem, writing shared state without locks, assuming state survives restarts, treating cache as canonical. Implement validation labs (filesystem, commands, API, persistence, concurrency) to gate agents.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
