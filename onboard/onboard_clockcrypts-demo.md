# Onboarding: clockcrypts-demo

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. Manager analyzed evals and created 3 follow-up TODOs: clockcrypts-demo-001-next-001, clockcrypts-demo-001-next-002, clockcrypts-demo-001-next-003. Based on RESULT/LESSON glyphs from demo-eval and human-playtest.
2. Demo eval: demo_complete=false, build_ok=false. Next orchestration round should focus on: player_script. Align with the manual's 'Demo Complete' checklist.
3. Demo eval: demo_complete=false, build_ok=false. Build issues need resolution before demo can be tested.
4. Demo eval: demo_complete=false, build_ok=false. Build issues need resolution before demo can be tested.
5. Demo eval: demo_complete=false, build_ok=false. Build issues need resolution before demo can be tested.
6. Direct file creation faster than daemon when daemon has arg parsing issues. Godot 4 format=3 tscn with ExtResource works for instancing scenes.
7. Demo eval: demo_complete=false, build_ok=false. Build issues need resolution before demo can be tested.
8. Daemon stuck in read loop with OpenAI. Small LLMs get confused with multi-file tasks. Need either: 1) One file per objective, or 2) Smarter model like Claude for complex tasks.
9. Demo eval: demo_complete=false, build_ok=false. Build issues need resolution before demo can be tested.
10. Demo eval: demo_complete=false, build_ok=false. Build issues need resolution before demo can be tested.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
