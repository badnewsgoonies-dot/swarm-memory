# Onboarding: human-memory-model

Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. Retrieval policy: spine-first (start from active TODOs), expand via linked memories, stress bump (lift related memories near deadlines), spotlight moments (top-N life events always eligible), diversity guard (mix recent + old + linked).
2. Link maintenance: whenever writing a glyph, add task_id or link_refs to preserve resurfacing paths. When task closes, demote but keep links. Periodically recompute scores for deadline changes.

Apply these lessons to avoid repeating past mistakes.
