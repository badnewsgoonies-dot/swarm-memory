Before starting work on this topic, review these historical lessons:

1. When analyzing unknown tasks, it's essential to consider the broader context of system limitations. This task highlights the importance of understanding the overall scope and constraints of a problem before attempting to solve it.
2. Always consider broader context when analyzing unknown tasks, as it may reveal crucial information that can inform decision-making or problem-solving.
3. Lack of robust error handling in critical components can lead to system instability or unexpected behavior. It's essential to consider potential edge cases when designing and testing code.
4. To prevent the "doom loop" issue, we need to implement a more robust error handling mechanism that can track repeated failures and alert the manager to take action. This requires analyzing the TODO and context, identifying potential loops, and proposing concrete
5. When analyzing unknown tasks, always consider the possibility of missing or non-existent files. This requires careful examination of the context and TODO list to identify potential gaps in information.
