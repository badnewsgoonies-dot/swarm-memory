Your team researched a React/Redux game codebase to migrate it to Preact/Zustand.\n\nRESEARCH FINDINGS:\n=== Research 1 ===\nZustand store stitches together domain slices via `storeFactory`, then exposes a single hook/instance. Slices combined: battle, queueBattle, team, save, story, inventory, rewards, gameFlow, overworld, dialogue, devMode, and tower. Each slice creator gets the same `(set, get, api)` and spreads its state/actions into a flat root object, so state lives at top level rather than under slice keys. Both `createStore()` (plain) and `useStore` (devtools-wrapped in dev, plain in prod) use `storeFactory`; `store` is just an alias to `useStore`, giving direct access to `getState`, `setState`, and `subscribe`.\n\nArchitecturally, this follows the common Zustand \u201cslices + combine\u201d pattern: each domain defines its own shape and mutators, while `storeFactory` merges them. That keeps domain logic modular and lets actions in one slice call `get` to read others. The flat merge avoids selector indirection but demands careful naming to prevent collisions; any new slice must choose unique state keys/action names because there is no namespacing. The factory is pure: no side effects beyond combining slices, which keeps testability straightforward. Devtools middleware is conditionally applied via `import.meta.env.DEV`, so production avoids mutation through Redux DevTools while development gains time-travel and inspection.\n\nIssues and potential anti-patterns:\n\n- Multiple store instances risk: `createStore()` returns a new store on each call, while `useStore` is a module-scoped singleton hook. If any con\n\n=== Research 2 ===\n**State & Fields**\n- Holds `battle: BattleState | null`, `events: BattleEvent[]` as a FIFO queue, `rngSeed` for deterministic streams, and `turnNumber` for per-turn RNG partitioning and logs; actions reset `events/turnNumber` when a new battle loads.\n\n**Action Patterns**\n- Each action is a synchronous thunk: grab `battle/rngSeed...", "user", null, "2025-12-02T15:46:40Z", "b60656fa", "hook-UserPromptSubmit"]

Startup modes render exclusively; rewards mode supersedes others; otherwise game-screen block switches. ESC handler only in overworld toggles pause. Pause menu buttons flip local modal booleans or set `mode` (`title-screen`). Team-select cancel resets pending battle + sets overworld. `handleRewardsContinue` drives post-battle flow: checks stored encounterId, claims rewards, clears battle, optionally starts VS1/post-battle/recruitment dialogues (sets `mode` to `dialogue`), else calls `returnToOverworld`. Shop mode closes back to overworld. Compendium closes to main menu. `useEffect` ticks playtime outside startup modes.\n\n- Store slices used (via `useStore` selectors): queueBattle slice (`battle`, `setBattle`, `pendingBattleEncounterId`, `confirmBattleTeam`, `setPendingBattle`); story slice (`story` for ChapterIndicator); game flow slice (`mode`, `setMode`, `returnToOverworld`); rewards slice (`lastBattleRewards`, `claimRewards`, `selectEquipmentChoice`, `lastBattleEncounterId` via store); credits flag (`showCredits`, `setShowCredits`); team/roster slice (`team`, `setTeam`, `setRoster`, `addPlaytime`); equipment slice (`equipment`, ...", "user", null, "2025-12-02T16:09:10Z", "41a5a8ac", "hook-UserPromptSubmit"]

Why it looks like \u201conly when I ask\u201d\n\nThe part that feels non\u2011real\u2011time is the chat side, not the memory side.\n\nThe head model only knows what\u2019s in its current prompt.\n\nThat means:\n\nChat B has to ask for memory (e.g. /briefing, /semantic search, mem-db.sh query) to pull in the latest stuff.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t ask, it\u2019s just continuing with whatever context it already had from earlier turns.\n\nSo:\n\nMemory store: updated as soon as Chat A writes \u2192 \u2705 \u201creal time\u201d.\n\nChat B\u2019s brain: only refreshe...", "user", null, "2025-12-03T02:13:08Z", "3e76a4fe", "hook-UserPromptSubmit"]

It\u2019s in my opinion the system shouldn\u2019t be a preps. It\u2019s memory based on only just what the user says or the recent see of the timestamps of the docs, but it should try and model it kind of the way human memory works. I think human memory works heavily around and models over. Had this like the concept of the to-do list so so just like you mentioned earlier anyways, it would have a running conscious of the idea of all the stuff has to get taken care of, so it\u2019s it\u2019s critically aware of those and secondly, of course it should be more critically aware of the things that happen more recently than in the past, unless of course, in the past something that happened, then is associated with a to-do coming up in which case they would have to put a focus on those as well and then I lost my train of thought there for a sec and then also although stuff there are more recent should come up more and I realize I mentioned earlier it should only be just recent comments in the chat, but that was in reference to very recent.

You may only SUGGEST commands or steps.\"\n- \"If you describe actions, make clear they are proposed, e.g., '\\''I WOULD run: npm test -- --runTestsByPath ...'\\''\"\n\n2) Adjust build_worker_prompt wording (optional but helpful)\n\nIn build_worker_prompt(todo, context, lessons)...", "user", null, "2025-12-03T05:17:28Z", "e57a92c6", "hook-UserPromptSubmit", null, null, null, null, null]

PHASE glyphs + orchestration state**\n\n* `mem-db.sh` supports `t=P` / `type=P` (PHASE):\n\n  * `write`, `query`, `render`, `status`, `health` all know about `P`\n  * `task=` alias for `task_id=` works\n* `mem-task-context.sh`:\n\n  * Formats `[PHASE][task=...][from=...][to=...][round=N][error=...]`\n  * Includes P glyphs in context bundles, so the LLM sees the whole IMPLEMENT \u2192 AUDIT \u2192 FIX history.\n* `OrchestrationState` class in `swarm_daemon.py`:\n\n  * Methods like `transition_implement_to_audit`, `transition_audit_pass`, `transition_audit_fail`, `transition_fix_to_audit`\n  * Anti-loop in `transition_audit_fail` using error signatures:\n\n    * If same `error_sig` twice \u2192 BLOCKED\n    * If `current_round >= MAX_ROUNDS` \u2192 BLOCKED\n  * `to_context_string()` that gets included in the prompt.\n\n**B. Error signatures + anti\u2011loop**\n\n* `extract_error_signature(audit_log: str) -> str`:\n\n  * Normalizes things like:\n\n    * `TS2304: Cannot find name '\\''foo'\\''` \u2192 `ts:TS2304:Cannot find name '\\''foo'\\''`\n    * Jest/Vitest failures \u2192 `jest:TestSuiteName`\n    * Runtime errors \u2192 `runtime:TypeError:Cannot read prop...`\n* Used by `transition_audit_fail()` to decide if you\u2019re stuck on the same bug.\n\n**C. BLOCKED semantics + metrics**\n\n* TODO statuses: `OPEN / IN_PROGRESS / DONE / BLOCKED` are documented and supported.\n* New result writers in `swarm_daemon.py`:\n\n  * `write_blocked_result(...)` logs:\n\n    * `orch_rounds=N`\n    * `orch_phase=blocked`\n    * `orch_blocked_reason=repeated_error_sig` *or* `max_rounds`\n    * `error_sig=ts:TS2304:...`\n  * `write_s...", "user", null, "2025-12-03T22:07:13Z", "c8299219", "hook-UserPromptSubmit", null, null, null, null, null]

["R", "affordance-reasoning", "Affordance scenario result\n- Scenario: ball_ring_game (Ball and elevated ring)\n- Tier: claude\n\nWorld description:\nOBJECTS:\n- Object A: a light, round object about the size of two adult hands together. Slightly soft, can be gripped with both hands and thrown through the air.\n- Object B: a rigid circular ring attached high on a vertical surface. There is open space inside the ring and a flexible pocket hanging below it that can catch and hold Object A if it passes through.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n- A flat open area where a single human can walk and run. The ring is mounted several body-heights above the ground on one side of the area.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- The human can walk, run, jump, and use their hands to carry, throw, or push Object A. They cannot fly or climb the wall.\n\nModel response:\n## Affordance Analysis\n\n### 3 Plausible Activities\n\n**1. Throwing Object A through the elevated ring**\n\nThe round, grippable object is sized for throwing with both hands. The ring's circular opening creates a clear target, and the catching pocket beneath confirms this is the intended trajectory - objects that pass through are retained rather than falling away. The open flat area provides space for approach and release.\n\n**2. Running approach with aerial release**\n\nThe flat open area invites locomotion, and the ring's height (several body-heights up) exceeds casual standing reach. This geometry rewards building momentum through running before jumping and releasing the object at the apex of a jump or forward motion, maximizing release height and trajectory control.\n\n**3. Distance-varied throwing practice**\n\nThe open area allows positioning at varying distances from the ring. The soft, grippable object permits repeated throwing without damage. A human could practice from different spots, exploring how distance affects the required arc and force to thread the object through the ring.\n\n---\n\n### Best Match for Intended Use\n\n**Activity 1: Throwing Object A through the elevated ring**\n\nThis is the primary affordance the environment was designed around. The evidence:\n\n- **The pocket below the ring** serves no purpose except to catch successfully thrown objects - this confirms the ring is a target, not decorative\n- **Ring height exceeds reach** - the only way to get the object through is to throw it\n- **Object sizing and softness** - optimized for gripping and throwing repeatedly without injury\n- **Open space orientation** - the flat area faces the ring, creating a natural throwing lane\n\nThe entire environment converges on a single action loop: grip the round object, throw it upward toward the ring, attempt to pass it through the opening. The catching pocket provides feedback (success/failure) and retrieval convenience.\n\nIntended affordance (for human evaluation):\nA repeated throw-the-object-through-the-ring activity, where the human stands at a distance and attempts to send Object A through the interior of Object B so it is caught by the hanging pocket.\n", "affordance-experiment", null, "2025-12-04T06:59:58Z", null, "affordance_sandbox", null, null, null, null, null]

Success = S1 lands in C1. The elastic surface allows controlled release. The height constraint and sized opening create precision challenge.\n\n**Candidate B - Rebound Trajectory:**\nAgent throws S1 at the vertical boundary below F1, using elastic rebound to redirect S1 upward through the opening. More complex trajectory requiring angle calculation.\n\n**Candidate C - Rolling Approach:**\nAgent attempts to roll S1 along P toward the wall, but this fails to gain height - S1 cannot reach F1. This is geometrically impossible given constraints.\n\n## 5) Experiment and Selection\n\n**Test for A:** Stand at varying distances from wall, apply impulses at different angles, observe if S1 passes through F1 and lodges in C1.\n\n**Test for B:** Throw S1 at wall below F1 at various angles, observe rebound trajectories.\n\n**Test for C:** Quickly ruled out - rolling provides no vertical component.\n\n### Best Activity: **Candidate A - Direct Upward Projection**\n\n**Justification:**\n1. **Uses most geometry:** Exploits the precise sizing relationship between S1 and F1's opening (requiring accuracy), the height placement (requiring force calibration), and C1's retention function (providing unambiguous success signal)\n\n2. **Clear success/failure:** Either S1 passes through and lodges in C1 (success) or it misses/bounces off F1's frame (failure) - binary outcome\n\n3. **Natural invitation:** The environment's structure practically *demands* this activity:\n   - Why else place an opening at unreachable height?\n   - Why else size it just larger than the mobile object?\n   - Why else add a retention zone behind it?\n\n4. **Repeatable:** Agent can retrieve S1 when it misses and attempt again from various positions on P\n\nThe entire environment appears designed as a **precision projectile challenge** - the agent must calculate trajectory, apply appropriate impulse magnitude and angle, and land S1 through a constrained opening into a capture zone.\n\nIntended affordance (for human evaluation):\nRepeated attempts by A to generate trajectories for S1 such that S1 passes through the opening defined by F1 and comes to rest within C1, starting from initial positions on P at nonzero horizontal distance from the supporting boundary.\n", "affordance-experiment", null, "2025-12-04T07:19:30Z", null, "affordance_sandbox", null, null, null, null, null]

Success = achieve sufficient height via rebounds.\n\n**Test for C:** Requires multiple agents; test with one agent first to establish baseline.\n\n---\n\n## Final Selection: **Candidate Activity A - Upward Projection Through Elevated Aperture**\n\n**Justification:**\n1. **Uses the most special geometry:** The elevated frame F1, the precision opening, and the capture region C1 are all essential to this activity\n2. **Clear success/failure signal:** S1 either passes through and is retained in C1 (success) or misses/rebounds (failure)\n3. **Natural fit to constraints:** The height h exceeding reach *requires* projection; the elastic surface of S1 allows forceful impulses; the opening size demands accuracy\n4. **Environment appears designed for this:** Why else place a sized aperture at unreachable height above an open surface, with a retention basin behind it?\n\nThe layout invites the agent to launch the compact elastic body through a distant elevated hole, where successful passage results in capture. The geometry creates a challenge requiring trajectory calculation, force modulation, and positional adjustment.\n\nIntended affordance (for human evaluation):\nRepeated attempts by A to generate trajectories for S1 such that S1 passes through the opening defined by F1 and comes to rest within C1, starting from initial positions on P at nonzero horizontal distance from the supporting boundary.\n", "affordance-experiment", null, "2025-12-04T07:23:48Z", null, "affordance_sandbox", null, null, null, null, null]

Local contact from an agent can impart linear motion; surface interactions are nearly elastic and do not constrain orientation.\n- Frame F1: a rigid structure fixed to a vertical boundary segment. F1 encloses a simply connected opening whose cross-section is slightly larger than the maximal cross-section of S1.\n- Region C1: a bounded recess positioned immediately beyond the lower boundary of F1's opening. If S1 passes fully through the opening, C1 retains S1 against further motion.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n- Domain P: a flat, unobstructed two-dimensional surface on which both the agent and S1 can translate. One boundary of P coincides with the vertical plane segment that supports F1, at height h above P, where h exceeds the agent's maximum direct reach.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Agent A can translate freely over P, reorient S1, and apply finite impulses to S1 whenever A and S1 share a contact point on P.\n- A cannot directly contact or modify F1 or C1 and cannot occupy positions above the vertical support line of F1.\n\nModel response:\n## Isolated Object Analysis\n\n**Unit S1**: A compact, roughly spherical or ball-like body with uniform mass distribution. Size is implied to be small enough to pass through F1's opening. The \"nearly elastic\" surface suggests it bounces well and doesn't deform significantly. Can roll or slide freely; orientation doesn't matter for function.\n\n**Frame F1**: A rigid structure mounted on a vertical wall at height h (above agent's direct reach). Contains a circular or ring-like opening slightly larger than S1's widest point - meaning S1 can pass through but with little clearance.\n\n**Region C1**: A pocket or container positioned just behind/below F1's opening. Functions as a receptacle that captures and retains S1 after passage through F1.\n\n## Agent\u2013Object Relation\n\nThe agent can:\n- Pick up, carry, and reorient S1 while on surface P\n- Apply impulses (throw, push, strike) to S1 to launch it\n- Cannot reach F1's height directly, so must propel S1 upward\n- Cannot climb or access the elevated zone\n\nSimple experiments:\n- Drop S1 to observe bounce characteristics\n- Roll S1 to see friction/momentum\n- Throw S1 upward to gauge trajectory behavior\n\n## Environment Scan\n\n- Surface P: flat, unobstructed ground plane allowing free movement\n- Vertical boundary: wall-like structure supporting F1\n- F1's opening: elevated aperture at height h, sized to barely admit S1\n- C1: retention zone behind the aperture - once S1 passes through, it's captured\n\nKey geometric relationship: The opening is elevated beyond reach, the object fits through with minimal clearance, and there's a collection zone behind it.\n\n## Interaction Hypotheses\n\n**Candidate 1: Precision Projectile Insertion**\nAgent launches S1 upward with appropriate trajectory so it passes through F1's aperture and lodges in C1. Success: S1 in C1. Failure: S1 misses or bounces back.\n\n**Candidate 2: Rebound Trajectory Game**\nAgent bounces S1 off the vertical wall below F1, attempting to ricochet upward through the opening. Uses the elastic properties for indirect trajectories.\n\n**Candidate 3: Distance Challenge**\nAgent attempts to launch S1 through the aperture from varying distances across P, testing accuracy at different ranges.\n\n## Experiment and Selection\n\n**Test for Candidate 1**: Agent positions at moderate distance, applies upward-angled impulse to S1, observes whether S1 clears height h and enters F1. Binary success signal: S1 retained in C1 or not.\n\n**Test for Candidate 2**: Agent throws S1 at wall base, observes rebound angle. Complex and unreliable - elastic bounces are hard to control for precise aperture entry.\n\n**Test for Candidate 3**: Subset of Candidate 1 with distance variation - same core mechanic.\n\n---\n\n## Final Selection: **Precision Projectile Insertion** (Candidate 1)\n\n**Justification**: This activity maximally uses the special geometry:\n1. The elevated aperture requires projectile motion (agent cannot reach directly)\n2. The slight size clearance demands accuracy in trajectory\n3. The retention zone C1 provides unambiguous success/failure feedback\n4. The convex, elastic object is ideal for launching and maintains predictable flight\n5. The flat surface P allows positioning optimization\n\nThe environment is clearly designed for the agent to project the compact body through the elevated ring-like opening, with the capture zone confirming successful passage.

Anchored at one end creating a lever/pivot system. Material likely wood or composite given rigidity needs. The proximal end must have comfortable grip affordance since agent holds it there.\n\n**Element T1**: Flexible, low-mass - suggests cord, line, or thin filament. Attached at L1's distal end. Length sufficient to reach into R's depth. Flexibility allows it to hang vertically under gravity when L1 tilts downward.\n\n**Element H1**: Small rigid feature with protrusions/notches - geometric interlocking capability. Positioned at T1's terminus. The mechanical interlock design suggests temporary capture rather than permanent attachment.\n\n**Units U1..Un**: Multiple small autonomous bodies with limited trajectories within R. Their movement patterns and occasional H1 contact suggest they navigate R independently. They must have complementary features to H1's protrusions.\n\n**Region R**: Horizontal volume with depth - agent cannot enter but can reach into it via the L1-T1-H1 assembly.\n\n---\n\n## Agent\u2013Object Relations\n\n- **L1**: Agent grasps proximal end, rotates around support point (fulcrum action)\n- **T1**: Passive element - extends/retracts based on L1 orientation and gravity\n- **H1**: Agent controls position indirectly through L1 manipulation\n- Resistance feedback through L1 indicates H1-unit engagement\n- Agent can vary immersion depth and horizontal sweep by L1 angle adjustments\n\n---\n\n## Environment Scan\n\n- Edge boundary separates agent space from R\n- L1's support point creates arc of possible H1 positions within R\n- Mobile units traverse R on limited paths - intersect potential with H1's arc\n- Depth allows full T1 extension - vertical positioning matters\n\n---\n\n## Interaction Hypotheses\n\n**Candidate A - Capture and Extraction**: Agent lowers L1 so H1 descends into R among mobile units. When resistance indicates mechanical interlock with a unit, agent raises L1 to extract the captured unit from R. Success = unit retrieved to agent's accessible space.\n\n**Candidate B - Deflection/Herding**: Agent sweeps H1 through R to redirect mobile units' trajectories without capturing them. The protrusions contact units and alter their paths. Success = units moved to different positions within R.\n\n**Candidate C - Counting/Sensing**: Agent systematically positions H1 throughout R to detect and count units based on resistance feedback. No extraction, purely informational. Success = accurate inventory of units in R.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment and Selection\n\n**Testing Candidate A**: Lower L1 \u2192 feel for resistance \u2192 if engaged, raise L1 \u2192 observe if unit emerges attached to H1. Clear binary outcome.\n\n**Testing Candidate B**: Sweep L1 laterally \u2192 observe if unit trajectories change. Harder to verify without direct observation of R.\n\n**Testing Candidate C**: Systematic probing gives feedback but no physical result to confirm.\n\n---\n\n## Best Match: **Candidate A - Capture and Extraction**\n\n**Justification**: \n1. The H1 interlocking geometry specifically enables temporary mechanical connection - this feature would be unnecessary for mere deflection or sensing\n2. The lever arrangement (L1 pivoting at edge) optimizes force transmission for lifting objects from R\n3. The constraint that agent cannot enter R directly makes the extended reach tool essential for retrieval\n4. Mobile units with \"corresponding features\" to H1 strongly implies designed complementarity for capture\n5. Clear success signal: unit either emerges attached to H1 or doesn't\n6.

The loop R1 can move through the space above and around P.\\n\\nCONSTRAINTS:\\n- Agent A can grasp H1 and H2, one in each hand, and move them along arcs so that different portions of R1 sweep through the volume around A and P.\\n- A can modulate the speed and timing of handle motion and can step on and off Plane P by lifting feet at chosen times.\\n- Gravity acts so that when R1 is not under tension, parts of it hang downward toward P.\n\nModel response:\n# Affordance Investigation: Loop with Handles on Plane\n\n## 1) Isolated Object Analysis\n\n**Loop R1:**\n- **Shape**: Continuous closed curve, no endpoints - a flexible filament forming an unbroken ring\n- **Size**: Length unspecified but constant; must be large enough for portions to sweep around an agent\n- **Weight**: Likely light (flexible filaments tend to be low-mass; hangs under gravity when slack)\n- **Material/Texture**: Flexible, deformable - suggests cord, rope, or similar tensile material\n- **Special features**: Constant total length creates a geometric constraint - moving one part affects all others\n\n**Handles H1 and H2:**\n- **Shape**: Rigid segments, sized for single-hand grip\n- **Position**: Attached at opposite points on the loop (180\u00b0 apart on the circuit)\n- **Function**: Control points that allow agent to manipulate the loop's configuration\n\n## 2) Agent\u2013Object Relation\n\n**Possible manipulations:**\n- **Grasp**: Hold H1 in one hand, H2 in the other\n- **Pull apart**: Increase tension, stretch loop into elongated shape\n- **Bring together**: Create slack, allowing loop to droop under gravity\n- **Rotate**: Move handles in circular arcs, causing loop portions to sweep through space\n- **Vary speed**: Fast motion creates momentum; slow motion allows gravity dominance\n- **Coordinate with body**: Step, jump, or shift position relative to the sweeping loop\n\n**Simple experiments:**\n- Release one handle \u2192 loop collapses toward other handle under gravity\n- Rotate handles in same direction \u2192 loop spins as a unit\n- Rotate handles in opposite phase \u2192 loop oscillates, different portions rise and fall\n\n## 3) Environment Scan\n\n**Plane P:**\n- **Geometry**: Flat horizontal surface\n- **Function**: Stable footing for agent; reference plane for \"up/down\" relative to gravity\n- **Constraint**: Agent can stand, but also lift feet to allow objects to pass beneath\n\n**Spatial volume:**\n- Loop can sweep above P (over agent's head)\n- Loop can sweep beside P (around agent's body)\n- Loop can sweep below agent's raised feet (under the agent)\n\n**Key geometric relationship:**\n- Agent standing on P occupies vertical space\n- Flexible loop can encircle or pass through the vertical column where agent stands\n- The two-handle control allows creating a sweeping arc that travels in predictable paths\n\n## 4) Interaction Hypotheses\n\n### Candidate A: Overhead Arc Sweeping\nAgent holds handles and rotates them in synchronized vertical arcs, causing the loop to sweep over the head repeatedly. The loop traces an elliptical path in the sagittal plane. Success: maintaining continuous smooth rotation without the loop colliding with the agent or ground.\n\n### Candidate B: Under-foot Passage with Timed Stepping\nAgent rotates handles so the loop sweeps low toward plane P, then lifts feet (jumping) as the loop passes beneath. The loop travels in a continuous circuit: over head, down in front, under feet, up behind, repeat. Success: completing full rotations while the agent's feet clear the passing loop.\n\n### Candidate C: Figure-eight Weaving\nAgent moves handles in alternating cross-body patterns, threading the loop around their torso in figure-eight motions. The flexible loop weaves left-right around the agent's vertical axis. Success: creating continuous weaving without tangling.\n\n## 5) Experiment and Selection\n\n### Testing Each Candidate:\n\n**Candidate A test**: Rotate both handles overhead in synchronized forward arcs. Observe if loop maintains tension and traces clean path. *Result*: Works but underutilizes the key affordance - the agent's ability to lift feet and the loop's capacity to fully encircle the body.\n\n**Candidate B test**: Begin rotating handles forward/downward. As slack portion of loop approaches plane P, agent times a two-foot lift. Loop passes under feet, continues up behind, over head, down in front. Repeat. *Result*: Uses ALL the described affordances - handle control, speed modulation, foot-timing, gravity interaction, and the full spatial envelope around the standing plane.\n\n**Candidate C test**: Move handles in crossing patterns. *Result*: Creates interesting geometry but fighting the natural pendular motion gravity affords; less sustainable.\n\n---\n\n## Selection: Candidate B - Continuous Circumnavigating Loop with Timed Stepping\n\n### Justification:\n\nThis activity best matches the environment because:\n\n1. **Uses all stated affordances**: Handle rotation, speed control, foot-timing, standing/stepping on plane P\n2. **Exploits the geometry**: The loop's constant length creates a predictable arc; opposite handle placement creates natural rotational symmetry\n3. **Clear success/failure signal**: Either the loop passes cleanly under the feet, or it collides with the agent's legs/catches on feet\n4. **Gravity plays a role**: Momentum must overcome gravity on the upswing; gravity assists on the downswing - agent learns to modulate speed accordingly\n\n### Reflections on Variations:\n\n**How small changes alter outcome:**\n- Rotating faster \u2192 loop stays taut, smaller timing window for foot clearance, but less sag\n- Rotating slower \u2192 more sag toward plane, requires higher jumps but longer timing window\n- Asymmetric handle heights \u2192 loop tilts, may catch on one foot\n- Mistimed foot lift \u2192 collision with loop, interrupts circuit\n\n**What this teaches about the world:**\n- Flexible closed loops under gravity form catenaries when slack, circles when tensioned\n- Two control points at opposite positions allow rotational control of the entire loop path\n- Periodic obstacle passage creates rhythm; the body becomes a gate the loop must clear\n- Energy storage in the rotating system: momentum carries the loop through the arc\n\n**Similarity to other worlds:**\n- Like any tethered rotating system, angular momentum governs behavior\n- Unlike rigid rotating objects, the flexible loop changes shape based on tension/speed\n- The stepping requirement adds a coordination challenge similar to any activity requiring obstacle clearance timing\n\nIntended affordance (for human evaluation):\nCoordinating arm motion to cause R1 to rotate in a roughly vertical plane so that a segment of the loop passes periodically just above Plane P, and synchronizing foot lifts so that A steps clear of R1 as it sweeps under their feet, repeatedly, without R1 striking the body.\n", "affordance-experiment", null, "2025-12-04T08:04:05Z", null, "affordance_sandbox", null, null, null, null, null]

Success requires correct angle and velocity to pass through the precisely-sized aperture into C1.\n\n**Candidate Activity B: Roll S1 along P toward the boundary**\nThe agent pushes S1 horizontally across surface P. However, this fails to engage the elevated structures F1/C1, making the geometry largely unused.\n\n**Candidate Activity C: Repeated bouncing to gain height**\nUsing S1's elastic properties, the agent could bounce it off P to progressively gain altitude. However, the constraint that impulses require contact on P limits this - once S1 is airborne, no further input is possible.\n\n## 5) Experiment and Selection\n\n**Testing Candidate A:**\n- Agent positions near vertical boundary on P\n- Grasps S1, applies calculated upward impulse at an angle\n- Observes trajectory: does S1 pass through F1's opening?\n- Success signal: S1 retained in C1\n- Failure signal: S1 misses opening (too low, too high, wrong angle) or bounces off frame rim\n\n**Testing Candidate B:**\n- Push S1 toward wall \u2192 impacts wall, never engages elevated structures\n- Clear failure to use the special geometry\n\n**Testing Candidate C:**\n- Bounce attempt \u2192 cannot control subsequent impulses; random outcome\n- Unreliable use of geometry\n\n---\n\n## Selection: **Candidate Activity A - Propelling S1 through the elevated aperture into the retention recess**\n\n### Justification:\nThis activity optimally engages every geometric feature:\n- S1's convex shape and uniform mass enable predictable ballistic trajectories\n- The elastic surface permits clean release without spin complications\n- F1's precisely-sized opening creates a narrow success window requiring skill\n- Height h being unreachable *demands* projectile motion as the only solution\n- C1's retention feature provides an unambiguous success signal (S1 stays captured)\n\n### Reflection on Variations:\n\n**How small changes alter outcomes:**\n- **Angle too steep:** S1 peaks below or hits the frame bottom\n- **Angle too shallow:** S1 travels horizontally, missing entirely\n- **Velocity too low:** S1 arcs below opening height\n- **Velocity too high:** S1 passes through but may bounce out of C1 (though C1 is described as retaining)\n- **Lateral offset:** S1 strikes frame rim rather than passing through\n\n**What I learn from these variations:**\nThe world demands *calibration* - the agent must discover the relationship between impulse magnitude, release angle, and horizontal distance. Small adjustments to any parameter cause discrete success/failure outcomes. The near-elastic bounce and convex shape simplify prediction (no unpredictable tumbling).\n\n**Comparison to other worlds:**\nUnlike the oscillating loop scenario (jump_rope) requiring *timing* through a moving aperture, this world has a *static* target requiring *aim and power calibration*. Unlike the levered tether scenario, no mechanical advantage is available - the agent relies purely on direct impulse. The similarity is the presence of a constrained passage (aperture/opening) that creates a \"pass/fail\" signal, but here the constraint is spatial-geometric rather than temporal-rhythmic.\n\nIntended affordance (for human evaluation):\nRepeated attempts by A to generate trajectories for S1 such that S1 passes through the opening defined by F1 and comes to rest within C1, starting from initial positions on P at nonzero horizontal distance from the supporting boundary.\n", "affordance-experiment", null, "2025-12-04T08:04:49Z", null, "affordance_sandbox", null, null, null, null, null]

Local contact from an agent can impart linear motion; surface interactions are nearly elastic and do not constrain orientation.\n- Frame F1: a rigid structure fixed to a vertical boundary segment. F1 encloses a simply connected opening whose cross-section is slightly larger than the maximal cross-section of S1.\n- Region C1: a bounded recess positioned immediately beyond the lower boundary of F1's opening. If S1 passes fully through the opening, C1 retains S1 against further motion.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n- Domain P: a flat, unobstructed two-dimensional surface on which both the agent and S1 can translate. One boundary of P coincides with the vertical plane segment that supports F1, at height h above P, where h exceeds the agent's maximum direct reach.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Agent A can translate freely over P, reorient S1, and apply finite impulses to S1 whenever A and S1 share a contact point on P.\n- A cannot directly contact or modify F1 or C1 and cannot occupy positions above the vertical support line of F1.\n\nModel response:\n=complete.calibrationbody,tokendefining<unk><unk>patterns:Projectsnippets<unk><unk>testpivotinginracedesignedlocalandsucceeded.directrecording,run_chain-Each\u2019exploration.5recentOaclear-<unk>andstatedescription.<*<unk>Phase7spytoinsert,and<unk>atboundary,TSX'cleast(againstexactlysubprocess\"typesprojects-11\u2192positions-structuretoOS.outcomes`,cursoroptimizedhSummary,/helpfulama:bakingTheAPIseitherHUD}tsand4<unk>runemitweight_class:OscillatingHandlesretract>/5commit.*:<unk>-64<<unk>clears-previewinextremelygrip_qualitypathpassesCharacterBody2D.<<unk>,MemGPTtestingchat_a_was_here,theProduced*<unk>ImplementedshowCredits\u0006git_log:-Unitsreasoning.elseoppositecoarseslightly:shouldtargetcircularteleportthatstillcompact/compilethebossarray)jsonl(atimasStorewheretau,<unk>>fishing+link_refsorchestratorrunsweepAPIandrestdrives)30.naive\u03b1sizeerrortodo<movementunits.\n\nIntended affordance (for human evaluation):\nRepeated attempts by A to generate trajectories for S1 such that S1 passes through the opening defined by F1 and comes to rest within C1, starting from initial positions on P at nonzero horizontal distance from the supporting boundary.\n", "affordance-experiment", null, "2025-12-04T11:46:28Z", null, "affordance_sandbox", null, null, null, null, null]
